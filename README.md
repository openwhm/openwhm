# OpenWHM – An Open Source WHMCS Alternative
OpenWHM is a modern, open-source alternative to WHMCS — built with Laravel + Filament — that simplifies billing, client management, automation, and support for hosting providers, SaaS businesses, and digital service companies.

## 🛠 Roadmap
We’re developing OpenWHM in sprints. Here’s the high-level plan:
- Foundations (auth, clients, admin roles)
- Billing Core (invoices, payments, transactions)
- Products & Services (catalog, checkout, lifecycle)
- Domains Module
- Support System
- Automation & Reports

## 📜 License
OpenWHM is released under the AGPL v3 license.
This ensures that:

- The software remains free and open source.
- Any modifications used in a hosted/SaaS environment must also be shared back with the community.
- We believe this keeps innovation open while protecting contributors’ work.
